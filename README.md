# JudoCompetitionManager
<b>Judo Competition Manager</b><br />
1 Introduction<br />
Judo Competition Manager project will be a useful tool for organisers of judo
competitions and for the participants of such events. The application will allow
to choose the game system and plan fights. Organisers will use the manager to
add competitors and input data about results. We also address our application
to judokas, who will be able to follow events on the tournament they participate.<br />
2 Our motivations<br />
Joanna is a member of judo section of AGH Academic Sports Club. Competition
Manager could be used by her coach to simplify and shorten the process of
preparing and conducting judo events. Apart from that, we would like to gain
skills in operating a system connected to a database.<br />
3 Subject of demonstration<br />
Our plans include implementing algorithms creating the plan of competition for
different tournament structures (i.e. cup system or french system). We want
to store data in a database and enable users to read information uploaded by
organisers.<br />
4 The scope of the demonstration<br />
Our project will be a desktop application. This approach can be convenient for
organisers who will be able to use the application on their laptops, but will be
a downside for users of mobile devices. We chose desktop application because
we are familiar with such projects and our limit is a shortage of time. We see a
mobile Competition Manager as a possible extension of our project that can be
implemented in the future.<br />
